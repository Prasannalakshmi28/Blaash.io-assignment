# Video Playlist Manager

This project is a simple Video Playlist Manager built using React.js. It fetches video playlists and their respective video feeds via API calls, displays them in a user-friendly interface, and allows users to view details about each playlist and video.

## Features

- Fetch all playlists using the `getAllPlayList` API.
- Display the list of videos in each playlist using the `getfeeds_v1` API.
- Responsive UI to show playlist thumbnails, video counts, and details.
- Dynamic interaction: clicking a playlist opens the video list in a content area.
